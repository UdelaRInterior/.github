# How to contribute to [@UdelarInterior](https://github.com/UdelaRInterior)

First of all, thanks for your interest in contributing to our projects.

In this document we will summarize aspects related to how we expect to receive contributions. Feel free to contribute also to this documentation.

The work that is currently developed and planned in the short term, will be visible in the issues of each project.

For all our projects, we consider the `master` branch as a stable and suitable version for production environments (Unless otherwise specified in your `README.md`).


## Did you find a bug or do you have a new feature to propose?

The way to send us your comments is through issues. First look if there is already an issue related to the problem that concerns you. If so, join the discussion, otherwise create a new issue. Try to follow the issue template, explaining as much as you can and adding the corresponding tags (for example: `enhancement` for new features and` bug` for errors).


## Do you have a functional code to contribute to a project?
All pull requests are welcome. Start by forking the project that interests you. Work on the code that you want to send in a specific branch, maintaining the code conventions of the forked project.
Once you have finished, send us a pull request from that branch to the master branch of the original project. In the description of the pull request points out the changes/improvement made and what is its objective.
